# Live API Data Integration Real-Time Dashboard with Python & Power-BI.

This project focuses on building a live, interactive dashboard that monitors important global statistics such as health, education, employment, and other key development indicators. 

## 🚀 Project Overview
The core of this project is a seamless integration between data science and business intelligence:
* **Data Sourcing:** Data is pulled from a public API that is regularly updated with the latest global information.
* **Automation:** A Python script automatically fetches and processes this data for analysis.
* **Live Integration:** The script connects directly to Power BI, creating a live data connection that refreshes automatically without manual intervention.
* **Visualization:** The dashboard provides easy-to-understand charts and graphs to help users explore trends across different countries and regions.

## 📊 Analytical Goals
The dashboard is designed to address nine specific research questions to provide a comprehensive view of global development:

### 1. Economic & Social Baseline
Understand the foundational context of individual and national well-being:
* **Average GDP per capita** to sense individual economic well-being.
* **Average trade value** to measure international market activity.
* **Health spending relative to GDP** to indicate national investment priorities.
* **Average GDP growth rate** to reveal economic momentum.
* **Forest area proportion** to analyze land use and natural resource policies.

### 2. Regional Health Comparisons
Compare average health spending (as a % of GDP) **across different world regions** to highlight regional disparities and differences in health outcomes.

### 3. Socio-Economic Trend Analysis
Monitor how critical indicators—such as forest area, mobile/internet subscriptions, GDP, renewable energy, and unemployment—have **changed over time**.

### 4. Digital Impact on Health
Assess the relationship between higher internet penetration and **immunization rates** to see if digital connectivity improves health information access.

### 5. Internet & Employment
Investigate the potential economic impact of the internet, specifically if expanding access helps **reduce unemployment levels**.

### 6. Poverty Reduction: Underperformers
Pinpoint the **bottom 10 countries** showing the **least progress** in reducing poverty to help policymakers and NGOs focus resources where they are most needed.

### 7. Poverty Reduction: Top Performers
Identify the **top 10 countries** making the **most progress** in poverty reduction to learn from successful policies and strategies.

### 8. Health Indicator Interrelationships
Explore correlations between factors like health expenditure, life expectancy, immunization rates, child mortality, and disease burden to shape integrated health strategies.

### 9. Investment vs. Outcomes
Investigate whether **increased investment in health expenditure** is driving **improvements in life expectancy** using trend lines to determine if spending is an effective lever for population health.
